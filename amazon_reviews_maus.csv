1,5.0 out of 5 starsHeartwrenching stories - buy this book!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 10, 2024","The presentation is easy to follow and makes the heart-rending story of Nazi genocide of the Jews comprehensible for modern readers. Although after the atrocities of the Hamas led pogrom of October 2023, it's no longer inconceivable that Nazi Germany would have done the same thing. Jews are forced to decide what to do about such imposed sufferings: ignore the past and make every effort to live well, devote oneself to collective security to ensure such atrocities never happen again, or like Israel: defend oneself by fighting back. A difficult decision."

3,5.0 out of 5 starsCHILLING AND CALMING! NOT A GRUESOME READ.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024",The media could not be loaded.This book is an easy read. It transitions from past life tragedies in the holocaust to real time calmness In his present day. I love reading more about the lifestyle that they experience in these times when money has almost no bounds and food and gold is all people really care about. How people will deceive you and trade with you all to save their own life. Shows how relationships built will only help you when  the time comes. Breathe taking depiction and great read. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR SOMETHING GRUESOME THIS IS NOT IT. WATCH VIDEO.Complaints?Hate to say it but I was looking for more tragic stories. What he went through was tragic but I feel this depiction is rated E for everyone. I wanted to read about aushwitz and how people survived but it's mentioned in the book.  Not guesomely mentioned. Great book and shows life of people on the run. WATCH VIDEO.

5,5.0 out of 5 starsA Must Have for Any Library! A Must Read for Everyone!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2023","I purchased this book during Banned Books Week and had seen it and heard about it, but never picked it up. I’m not one that reads graphic or comic books, and just didn’t think it would keep my attention. I was so wrong!! This book is excellent, told in a way that is honoring to the author’s life story and the tragic and most humbling viewpoint of one father, husband, son, and friend strives to survive by beyond resourceful and helpful. Even when he had every reason to- the author’s father still believed in the kindness and goodness of others and kept his wife and her memory in the forefront of all he did. Such a beautiful and heartfelt story, and one that should be read and retold to never forget the plight so many Holocaust survivors experienced."
